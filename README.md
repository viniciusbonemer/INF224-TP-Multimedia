# INF224-TP-Multimedia
This repository contains a practical project developed during a Programming Paradigms course in 2020. The goal was to implement a simple multimedia management system in C++ to be ran in a "server", and to develop a GUI in Java that would run in a "client" and communicate with the server. One of the goals of the course was to discuss some key OOP concepts and to compare the differences of Java and C++. These goals are the basis for many of the decisions around the structure of the C++ part of the code.
